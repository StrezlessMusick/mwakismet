Mediawiki-Akismet

This is a project to add Akismet support to Mediawiki.  It will currently
run all page edits through the Akismet servers and disallow saving if
Akismet decides an edit is spam.  There is the beginning of an admin
interface to mark edits as spam or ham, but it doesn't allow submitting
to the Akismet servers.
